# ImageScanner
A GUI based Image Scanner Application which will help user to extract texts from an Image and Store it in a Text File

# Features
**Code Editor :** Editor which supports 'Java with Ant' Repository can be used, in my case I have used Appache NetBeans Editor.
<br />
In this I have used TextToSpeech API(freetts) to speak out the extracted text and OCR API (Tesseract OCR) to extract text from Images. This was basically build to learn GUI Development libraries of Java such as AWT, Swing and JavaFX. Although in this project only JavaFX Library is used but it can be built using other GUI Toolkits also. JavaFX is the most updated or latest GUI library so I preferred to use it in the project.

In this user has to upload a Image File, and after that user will select the text file where the **extracted text** has to be stored. I have used an editor window to show the extracted text and slider is used to increase and decrease the size of text.
